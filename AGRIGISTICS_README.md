## Challenges

Most of the challenges faced were styling-related. Designing and implementing the core features, such as the Data Table and Employee Information Panel (Overview cards), was straightforward, especially with the help of AI tools. 

The specific styling challenges encountered were:
- App card widths:
   The employee info panel presented challenges with width adjustment due to the header text, but Claude AI helped resolve these issues.
   Additionally, the data table card wasn't initially expanding correctly to fill the available space. This was resolved using AI tools.

- Currency pipes:
   The currency pipe didn't accept the 'ZAR' locale, so 'R' was used as a temporary solution. This requires further investigation and resolution.

- Sort icon on table column headers:
   This presented a challenge in achieving the correct height and alignment with the header text.


## AI Tool Usage

- What/Which Tools:
   ChatGPT, Claude, and GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 3.5)

- Why/Where:
   - Project Structure:
     For researching project scaffolding, folder structure, navigation implementation, and validating the use of signals in business logic, primarily ChatGPT and Claude were utilized.

   - Component Generation:
     GitHub Copilot was predominantly used as it integrates directly with VS Code and can reference the codebase. While components were created manually using the CLI, Copilot assisted with styling implementation, template logic generation, and business logic development (which was subsequently refined manually).

     Some guidance was necessary, such as explicitly requesting the use of control flow syntax and signal-based components.

   - Mock Data Creation:
     Mock data was generated by providing Claude with a cropped image of table data rows, along with the project's manually defined interface specifications.

   - Data Table Implementation:
     After initial manual setup of data table logic, Copilot helped implement:
     - Signal-based sorting and searching
     - Parent component search integration
     - Sorting icon animations
     - Table actions
     - Data table configurations

   - Currency Formatting:
     The spaced currency pipe was implemented using Copilot, guided by reference images of the desired formatting.

   - Visual Enhancements:
     Copilot efficiently implemented animations and hover effects, though some manual refinement was necessary.

   - Angular Version Migration:
     Copilot streamlined the Angular version upgrade process by:
     - Managing dependency updates
     - Resolving version conflicts
     - Implementing necessary configuration changes
     - Handling TypeScript compatibility adjustments

   - Git Repository Management:
     Copilot assisted with version control tasks including:
     - Repository initialization
     - Commit message formatting
     - Remote repository configuration
     - Push/pull operations handling

- Evaluation:
   GitHub Copilot proved invaluable for rapid development. It excelled at implementing animations, hover effects, and complex functionality like sorting and filtering with minimal prompt engineering.

   While AI tools occasionally showed limitations (such as not defaulting to control flow syntax in templates), these limitations often stemmed from inadequate prompting rather than tool capabilities. This underscores the importance of understanding best practices and fundamental concepts to guide AI tools effectively.
